<p>
    If a shorthand notation can be used, it should be used to make the code more concise.<br>
    This rule checks if all the keys used in the mapped notation are also available for a shorthand notation<br>
</p>

<p>Examples</p>
The following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
model:
   Activity: !Activity
       variables:
       -   name: $naam
           value: 'test'
           readOnly: true
</pre>

The following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
model:
   Activity: !Activity
       variables:
       - $naam
</pre>

<p>The following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
model:
   Activity: !Activity

       -   name: $naam
           value: 'test'
