<p>
    An OMT variable must always start with the $-symbol.
    This includes the variables, parameters and bindings.

<h2>Examples</h2>
The following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:
<pre>
model:
    MyActivity: !Activity
        variables:
        - $variable
        - $variableWithValue = 'value'

        params:
        - $param (string)

    MyComponent: !Component
        bindings:
            param: $param
</pre>

The following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:
<pre>
model:
    MyActivity: !Activity
        variables:
        - variable
</pre>
