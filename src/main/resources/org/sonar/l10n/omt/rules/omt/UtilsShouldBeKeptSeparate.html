<p>
    To keep our code organised we keep utilities such as root Queries and Commands in separate files.
    Utilities that require context from a ModelItem (Activity, Component) should be put in the commands/queries
    section of those components.<br>
    <br>
    The following items are considered utilities:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>ODT Commands/Queries in the file root</li>
        <li>OMT Procedure</li>
        <li>OMT Standalone Query</li>
    </ul>
    The following items are considered model items that should populate without utilities:<br>
    <ul>
        <li>OMT Activity</li>
        <li>OMT Component</li>
        <li>OMT Ontology</li>
        <li>OMT Loadable</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Examples</p>
<p>The following code snippet would <strong>PASS</strong>:</p>
<pre>
commands: |
    DEFINE COMMAND myCommand => {}

queries: |
    DEFINE COMMAND queries => {}

model:
    MyProcedure: !Procedure
        onRun:

    MyStandaloneQuery: !StandaloneQuery
        query:
</pre>

<p>the following code snippet would <strong>FAIL</strong>:</p>
<pre>
commands: |
    DEFINE COMMAND myCommand => {}

queries: |
    DEFINE COMMAND queries => {}

model:
    MyActivity: !Activity
        onStart:

    MyStandaloneQuery: !StandaloneQuery
        query:
</pre>
